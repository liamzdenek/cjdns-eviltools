This is a collection of utilities to generate all the CJDNS IPs. This README isn't really done yet, but neither is the software. If 
you don't know what you're doing, you probably shouldn't be here.

Just a friendly note here- if you're planning on using procedural to populate the DB, /NEVER/ run the random version. it will break
things horribly and it will all be your fault.
